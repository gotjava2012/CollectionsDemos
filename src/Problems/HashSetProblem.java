     * of unique identifiers and finding one identifier towards the end of the list that is unlike any others.
     * 
     * The straightforward approach would be to examine each word in reverse, comparing it to every other word for uniqueness. 
     * This brute-force method would result in poor time complexity, O(n^2), which is less than ideal for large datasets.
